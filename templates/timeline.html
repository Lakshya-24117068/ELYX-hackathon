      <h4>🎯 Primary Goal / Trigger</h4>
      <p>Rajesh (member) initiates contact to discuss his chronic health concerns (high BP, thyroid issues, migraines, and arthritis) and challenges from frequent travel.  
      The team’s goal is to establish a comprehensive baseline.</p>

      <p>Member (<strong>Rajesh</strong>) and the <strong>ELYX team</strong> (Ruby, Dr. Warren, Carla, Advik, Rachel).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-section">
      <h4>⚠️ Friction Points</h4>
      <p>None. Rajesh briefly questioned the need for a full diagnostic panel, which Dr. Warren addressed immediately with clear justification.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="timeline-section">
      <h4>✅ Final Outcome</h4>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Dr. Warren</strong> justified the diagnostic panel to establish a precise baseline.</li>
        <li><strong>Carla</strong> suggested a simple breakfast fix (yogurt + nuts) to stabilize cortisol.</li>
        <li><strong>Advik</strong> introduced a quick HRV hack (box breathing + electrolytes).</li>
        <li><strong>Rachel</strong> recommended a foundational mobility routine for arthritis.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The week concluded with test kit delivery and a clear plan to review results and propose a long-term strategy.</p>

    <div class="summary-blocks">
      <div class="summary-block">
        <h4>🎯 Primary Goal / Trigger</h4>
        <p>Rajesh's recurring knee pain from travel. The team's goal was to provide a targeted, practical solution while continuing to manage the overall onboarding process.</p>
      </div>

      </div>
      
      <div class="summary-block">
        <h4>⚡ Friction Points</h4>
        <p>None. The communication was direct and the solutions were tailored to Rajesh's lifestyle (e.g., short, easy drills for travel). The interdisciplinary response eliminated the need for Rajesh to coordinate with multiple experts himself.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="summary-block">
        <h4>✅ Final Outcome</h4>
        <p>Targeted Intervention & Seamless Logistics. Rachel provided a clear, actionable plan to address Rajesh's arthritis pain, supported by Advik’s data-driven insights and Carla’s nutritional advice on inflammation. Ruby handled the logistics of his physical exam with reminders and transport, while Dr. Warren delivered a crucial medical instruction. The team’s coordinated effort demonstrated ELYX’s ability to manage both strategic interventions and day-to-day coordination, making the process effortless and personalized for Rajesh.</p>

    <div class="summary-blocks">
      <div class="summary-block">
        <h4>🟢 All Okay / Positive Trends</h4>
        <p><strong>Glucose & HbA1c:</strong> Both are within the healthy range, showing no immediate pre-diabetes risk.</p>
        <p><strong>Total Cholesterol:</strong> Levels are healthy, a positive sign for long-term cardiovascular health.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="summary-block">
        <h4>🟡 Need Follow-Up</h4>
        <p><strong>Vitamin D:</strong> Level is 22 ng/mL (optimal 30–60). Supplement recommended to address fatigue and bone health.</p>
        <p><strong>TSH:</strong> At 5.5 mIU/L (normal 0.4–4.5). Medication is helping but thyroid still elevated, needs monitoring.</p>
        <p><strong>Cortisol:</strong> High-normal morning level indicates chronic stress, tied to BP and migraines.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="summary-block">
        <h4>🔴 Major Issues</h4>
        <p><strong>Blood Pressure:</strong> Average 145/95 mmHg (Stage 2 Hypertension). Immediate targeted interventions required.</p>
        <p><strong>C-Reactive Protein (CRP):</strong> >3.0 mg/L, indicating systemic inflammation — likely driving arthritis and migraines.</p>
        <p><em>Dr. Warren:</em> “These results give us a clear roadmap. The team will build Rajesh’s personalized plan focused on lowering CRP and BP as top priorities.”</p>

        <h4>🟢 Wins</h4>
        <p><strong>HRV & Sleep:</strong> Both showing steady upward trends, validating lifestyle changes.</p>
        <p><strong>Engagement:</strong> Rajesh consistently followed drills, supplements, and nutrition advice.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="summary-block">
        <h4>🟡 Ongoing Work</h4>
        <p><strong>TSH:</strong> Slight improvement, but thyroid still above optimal. Continuous monitoring required.</p>
        <p><strong>Cortisol:</strong> Still high-normal, signaling stress management is a key target.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="summary-block">
        <h4>🔴 Priority Focus</h4>
        <p><strong>Blood Pressure:</strong> Still Stage 2 hypertension — needs intensive intervention.</p>
        <p><strong>CRP:</strong> Elevated systemic inflammation remains the root driver of arthritis & migraines.</p>

        <h4>🔴 Priority Focus</h4>
        <p><strong>Travel Stress:</strong> HRV dropped to 28ms and recovery score fell to 47% ahead of travel, reflecting pre-trip anxiety.</p>
        <p><strong>Intervention Needed:</strong> Pre-travel sleep and hydration emphasized to buffer against cortisol spikes.</p>
